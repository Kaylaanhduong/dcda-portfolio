            <p>Welcome to my Skills Portfolio! This portfolio represents my first experience using GitHub and building a technical skills portfolio in DCDA 40833.</p>
            <p>Coming from a Strategic Communication background, I challenged myself to step outside my comfort zone and explore web development and data analytics. Each project reflects my progress, problem-solving, and willingness to learn something new.</p>

             <!-- Short and brief introduction about myself in order to better connect with the visitors -->
            <p><strong>Who I am:</strong> My name is Kayla Duong, and I am a Strategic Communication major at TCU. This portfolio was created for DCDA 40833 and represents my first experience building a website and using GitHub as a platform for documenting my work. </p>
            <p><strong>My interests:</strong> I am interested in storytelling, branding, and how digital platforms shape culture and communication. I was drawn to DCDA because it challenged me to look beyond creative strategy and explore the technical systems behind the digital world. </p>
            <!-- From the Stratcomm and Advertising perspective, I believe knowing the technical aspects of digital media is essential for effective communication and branding. -->
            <p><strong>What I hope to learn:</strong> Through this course, I hope to develop foundational technical skills in coding, data analysis, and visualization. As someone without a technical background, my goal is to step outside my comfort zone and gain confidence working with digital tools and data.</p>
            <!-- I know I am not good at these coding and even setting github and VSCode took me forever but I'm here to grow outside of my comfort zone -->

        <section id="reflection">
            <h2>Semester Reflection</h2>
            <!-- TODO: After completing all labs, write a reflection on your growth -->
            <p><strong>What I learned:</strong> In Lab 1, I learned how to set up a project using GitHub for the first time and how to work with HTML files in VS Code. I also learned the differences between pushing and pulling changes, how to comment my code, and how GitHub tracks edits, making it easier to trace mistakes and understand my workflow</p>
            <p><strong>Challenges I overcame:</strong> Setting everything up without a video walkthrough or in-class guidance was confusing at first, and I struggled to understand how to open my HTML file correctly in VS Code. I felt frustrated and wanted to give up several times, but after realizing I needed to open the project directly from GitHub, things began to click. Working through these challenges helped me build confidence with unfamiliar technical tools.</p>
            <p><strong>How I grew:</strong> [How did your understanding of digital culture and data analytics evolve?]</p>
            <p><strong>Looking ahead:</strong> [How will you apply these skills in the future?]</p>
